Speaker 1: Hey everyone, welcome to our podcast on current college lifestyle. I'm excited to be here today with our guest speaker, Jane, who recently graduated from college. Speaker 2: Thanks for having me! It's great to be here and talk about my college experience. Speaker 1: So, let's start with you, Jane. Can you tell us a little bit about your college experience and how it has influenced your lifestyle today? Speaker 2: Sure! I went to a large public university in the Midwest, and it was a great experience. I met a lot of new people, tried new things, and learned a lot about myself. One thing that really influenced my lifestyle was the emphasis on time management in college. With so many classes, assignments, and extracurricular activities, I had to learn how to prioritize my time and stay organized. Speaker 1: That's a great point. As a current college student, I can definitely relate to that. There's always so much to do, and it can be overwhelming at times. How did you balance your academic and social life in college? Speaker 2: It was definitely a challenge, but I found that making a schedule and sticking to it really helped. I would schedule time for studying, attending classes, and doing assignments, but also schedule time for socializing and participating in extracurricular activities. It was all about finding a balance that worked for me. Speaker 1: That's a good tip. I've been trying to find that balance myself, and it can be tough. Do you have any other tips for current college students who are trying to balance their academic and social lives? Speaker 2: I would say don't be afraid to say no sometimes. It's okay to prioritize your academic work over social events if you need to. And it's important to remember that everyone's college experience is different, so don't compare yourself to others. Speaker 1: That's really good advice. So, what about after college? How has your college experience influenced your lifestyle today?  Speaker 2: Well, I think college taught me a lot of valuable life skills, like time management, organization, and communication. These skills have helped me in my professional life and personal life as well. And I've also developed a passion for learning that I continue to pursue even after college. Speaker 1: That's great to hear. So, as a current college student, what do you think are some of the biggest challenges facing college students today? Speaker 2: I think one of the biggest challenges is the cost of college. It can be really expensive, and a lot of students end up with a lot of debt after graduation. And then there's also the challenge of finding a good work-life balance, especially if you're involved in extracurricular activities or have a part-time job. Speaker 1: Yeah, I definitely agree with that. It can be tough to balance everything, and the cost of college is a big issue. What do you think can be done to address these challenges? Speaker 2: I think there needs to be more support for college students, both financially and emotionally. More scholarships and grants would help alleviate some of the financial burden, and mental health resources could help students deal with the stress of college life.
